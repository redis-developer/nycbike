# NYC Bike

_[Build on Redis Hackathon](https://redislabs.com/hackathon-2021/) entry, mitchsw, 2021-05-12._

A visual geospatial index of over 58 million [bikeshare trips](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) across NYC. This could be helpful to capacity plan across the network, allowing you to investigate aggregated rush hour and weekend travel patterns in milliseconds!

## System Overview

The visual UI is built using:
  1.  [Redis Graph](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/) through [redismod](https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/redismod),
  2. a Go backend (behind an nginx reverse proxy),
  3. a React frontend.

This infrastructure can be started from docker-compose.yml.

This repo also includes a Go importer program to load the public dataset into Redis Graph.

### redismod

This project uses the [redismod](https://hub.docker.com/r/redislabs/redismod) Docker image. This was used (as per Hackathon requirements) instead Redis Enterprise Cloud as that did not yet support Redis Graph v2.4 (at time of development).

### backend

The Go backend uses the [redisgraph-go](https://github.com/Redis Graph/redisgraph-go) library to proxy graph queries from the frontend. The Go library didn't support the new `point()` type, so I sent PR [redisgraph-go#45](https://github.com/RedisGraph/redisgraph-go/pull/45) adding this feature.

To mark every station on the map (`/stations` API call), a simple Cypher query is used to fetch all the locations:

```sql
MATCH (s:Station) RETURN s.loc
```

To count all the edges in the graph (part of `/vitals` API call), another simple Cypher query is used:

```sql
MATCH (:Station)-[t:Trip]->(:Station) RETURN count(t)
```

The main Cypher query to retrieve journeys (`/journey_query` API call) is of the form:

```sql
MATCH (src:Station)<-[t:Trip]->(dst:Station)
WHERE distance(src.loc, point($src)) < $src_radius
  AND distance(dst.loc, point($dst)) < $dst_radius
RETURN
  (startNode(t) = src) as egress,
  sum(t.counts[0]) as h0_trip_count,
  ...
```

This matches all the `:Stations` within the `$src` and `$dst` circles, and all the trip edges between these stations (in both directions). This is a fast query due to the **geospatial index** on `:Station.loc` (see _offline_importer_ below). The returned `egress` is true if the trip started at `$src`, or false if it started at `$dst`. The aggregated trip graph presented on the UI is built by aggregating properties on these `:Trip` edges, for both egress and ingress traffic.

### frontend

The frontend is built in React, built around [react-mapbox-gl](https://github.com/alex3165/react-mapbox-gl) and custom drawing modes I implemented. The aggregated trip graph is built using [devexpress/dx-react-chart](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive).

This is my _first ever_ React project, be nice! ;)

### offline_importer

The offline importer iteratively downloads the public [Citi Bike trip data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), unzips each archive, and indexes all the trips into the `journeys` graph.

The graph contains every `:Station` as a node, an index on the station ID, and a [geospatial index](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/commands/#indexing) of the station's locations:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON :Station(loc)
```

Each of the 58 million journeys are represented as increments on the edge between the `src` and `dst` stations (there are ~818k unique `[src]->[dst]` edges). The graph is setup to aggregate trips based on the trip time of the week (into `7*24` hour buckets). This graph could easily be extended to also aggregate trips on other dimensions too.

To index a single trip, the following Cypher query is used:

```sql
MATCH (src:Station{id: $src})
MATCH (dst:Station{id: $dst})
MERGE (src)-[t:Trip]->(dst)
ON CREATE
  SET t.counts = [n in range(0, 167) | CASE WHEN n = $hour THEN 1 ELSE 0 END]
ON MATCH
  SET t.counts = t.counts[0..$hour] + [t.counts[$hour]+1] + t.counts[($hour+1)..168]
```

This either creates a new edge with one trip, or increments the appropriate counter on the edge to index the trip.

To efficiently write all 56 million trips, I use [pipelining](https://redis.io/topics/pipelining) and turn [`CLIENT REPLY OFF`](https://redis.io/commands/client-reply) for each batch. The bulk import takes a couple of hours.

## How to run

Create a [Mapbox Access Token](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/) and write it to `frontend/.env` (hint: use the public access token that starts with "pk." ):

```sh
echo "REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>" > frontend/.env
```

Build the visual UI components, and run it using Docker Compose:

```sh
$ docker build -t nycbike backend
$ cd frontend; export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider; npm install; npm run-script build; cd ..
$ docker-compose up

```

The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:80/, but the map will be blank as Redis is empty. Now, start indexing the public dataset:

```sh
$ cd offline_importer
$ go run main.go --reset_graph=true
2021/05/12 22:58:45 [importer] Importer running...

2021/05/12 22:59:05 [dww.0]: Flushing 10000 commands, 10000 trips
```

Each reload of the UI at http://localhost:80/ should show these trips accumulate. On the [live demo](https://nycbike.mitchsw.com/), I use a prebuilt `dump.rdb` which is 674MB on disk.
